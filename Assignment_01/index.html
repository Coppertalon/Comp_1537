                <b>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci</b><sup><a href="#">[b]</a></sup> (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an
                Italian
                <a href="#">polymath</a> of the
                <a href="#">High
                    Renaissance</a>
                who was
                active as a painter, <a href="#">draughtsman</a>, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and
                architect.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>While his
                fame
                initially
                rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his <a href="#">notebooks</a>, in
                which he made
                drawings
                and
                notes on
                a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and <a
                    href="#">paleontology</a>.
                Leonardo
                is widely
                regarded to have been a <a href="#">genius</a> who epitomized the <a href="#">Renaissance humanist</a>
                ideal,<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup> and his collective
                works
                comprise a
                contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary,
                <a href="#">Michelangelo</a>.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>

            <p>
                Born <a href="#">out of wedlock</a> to a successful <a href="#">notary</a> and a lower-class woman in,
                or near, <a href="#">Vinci</a>, he was educated
                in
                Florence by
                the Italian painter and sculptor <a href="#">Andrea del Verrocchio</a>. He began his career in the city,
                but then spent
                much
                time in the
                service of <a href="#">Ludovico Sforza</a> in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as
                well as briefly in
                <a href="#">Rome</a>,
                all while
                attracting a <a href="#">large following</a> of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of <a
                    href="#">Francis I</a>, he spent his
                last
                three years
                in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements,
                diverse
                interests,
                <a href="#">personal life</a>, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and
                admiration<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>, making him a
                frequent
                <a href="#">namesake</a> and <a href="#">subject in culture</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Leonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the <a href="#">history of art</a> and is
                often credited as
                the
                founder of the
                High Renaissance.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup> Despite having many <a href="#">lost works</a> and <a
                    href="#">less than 25
                    attributed major works</a>â€”including
                numerous
                unfinished worksâ€”he created some of the most influential paintings in <a href="#">Western
                    art</a>.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup> <a href="#">His magnum opus</a>,
                the
                <a href="#">Mona
                    Lisa</a>, is
                his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous painting. The <a href="#">Last
                    Supper</a> is the most
                reproduced
                religious painting of all time and his <a href="#">Vitruvian Man</a> drawing is also regarded as a <a
                    href="#">cultural icon</a>. In
                2017,
                Salvator
                Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo,<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> was sold at auction for
                US$450.3 million, setting a
                new
                record for
                the <a href="#">most expensive painting ever sold</a> at public auction.

            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to
                his
                personal
                life.<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his "great physical beauty" and
                "infinite
                grace," as
                described by <a href="#">Vasari</a>,<sup><a href="#">[â€¡ 5]</a></sup> as well as all other aspects of his
                life, attracted
                the curiosity of others.
                One
                such
                aspect
                was his love for animals, likely including <a href="#">vegetarianism</a> and according to Vasari, a
                habit of purchasing
                caged
                birds and
                releasing them.<sup><a href="#">[99]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[â€¡ 6]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Leonardo had many friends who are now notable either in their fields or for their historical
                significance,
                including
                mathematician <a href="#">Luca Pacioli</a>,<sup><a href="#">[100]</a></sup> with whom he collaborated on
                the book <a href="#">Divina
                    proportione</a> in the 1490s.
                Leonardo
                appears
                to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with <a href="#">Cecilia
                    Gallerani</a> and the
                two
                Este
                sisters,
                <a href="#">Beatrice</a> and <a href="#">Isabella</a>.<sup><a href="#">[101]</a></sup> While on a
                journey that took him through <a href="#">Mantua</a>,
                he drew a portrait of
                Isabella
                that
                appears
                to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.<sup><a href="#">[37]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire,
                analysis, and
                speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries,
                most
                notably by
                <a href="#">Sigmund Freud</a> in his <a href="#">Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His
                    Childhood</a>.<sup><a href="#">[102]</a></sup>
                Leonardo's most intimate
                relationships
                were
                perhaps with his pupils <a href="#">SalaÃ¬</a> and <a href="#">Melzi</a>. Melzi, writing to inform
                Leonardo's brothers of his death,
                described
                Leonardo's
                feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that
                these
                relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four,
                show
                that
                Leonardo
                and three other young men were charged with <a href="#">sodomy</a> in an incident involving a well-known
                male
                prostitute.
                The
                charges
                were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de
                Tornabuoni, was
                related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.<sup><a
                        href="#">[103]</a></sup>Since that
                date
                much has
                been written about his presumed homosexuality<sup><a href="#">[104]</a></sup> and its role in his art,
                particularly in the
                <a href="#">androgyny</a>
                and
                <a href="#">eroticism</a>
                manifested in <a href="#">Saint John the Baptist</a> and <a href="#">Bacchus</a> and more explicitly in
                a number of erotic
                drawings.<sup><a href="#">[98]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[105]</a></sup>
